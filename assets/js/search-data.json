            "content": "Introduction . As the name implies, Imagemaking is the process of producing images from real life entities, either literally or metaphorically. The literal depiction of an object results in Denotative Images and the metaphorical depiction results in Connotative Images. For example, in the above image, there are two depictions of the fruit Apple. The one on the left is a generic depiction of an Apple, by itself. The depiction is straightforward and hence a denotative image. The one on the right has the apple slightly rotated and has a few streaks of lines above it. These two simple modifications now give another perspective to the image: now it depicts gravity or gravitational force. Thus, the modifications has made it a connotative image. .",
