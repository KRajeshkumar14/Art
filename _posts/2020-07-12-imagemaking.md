## Introduction

As the name implies, **Imagemaking** is the process of producing images from real life entities, either literally or metaphorically. The literal depiction of an object results in [**Denotative Images**](#denotative-images) and the metaphorical depiction results in [**Connotative Images**](#connotative-images).

For example, in the above image, there are two depictions of the fruit **Apple**. The one on the left is a generic depiction of an Apple, by itself. The depiction is straightforward and hence a **denotative** image. The one on the right has the apple slightly rotated and has a few streaks of lines above it. These two simple modifications now give another perspective to the image: now it depicts **gravity** or **gravitational force**. Thus, the modifications has made it a **connotative** image.
