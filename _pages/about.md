**கலை** or **Art** is the simpler dialect of the language of the universe [^1]. It enables us to break past the shackles of physical constraints and explore the realms of our imaginations.

Hi! My name is **Rajeshkumar K** and I am a sophomore student of BS-MS Physics at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. This blog is a documentation of my journey into Art: Graphic Design, Music, Generative Art, Pixel Art, Voxel Art and the like.

[^1]: The language of the universe is *Mathematics*, I believe.
